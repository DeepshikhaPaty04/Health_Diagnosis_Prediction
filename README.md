# Health Diagnosis Prediction Using Neural Networks

#### This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict health diagnoses based on patient data. Two models were implemented:

### 1) ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron): 
### A single-layer neural network using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) learning rule to minimize prediction error. It provides a baseline for linear prediction tasks.
### 2) Multilayer Neural Network: 
### A deep learning model with one hidden layer, employing ReLU activation and backpropagation to optimize weight values for improved binary classification performance.

## Key Features:
### --> Dataset: Includes attributes like BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet quality, and sleep quality.
### --> Preprocessing: Feature normalization using mean and standard deviation.
### --> Model Training: Trained over 5 epochs to optimize weights and biases for accurate predictions.
### --> Activation Functions: ReLU for the hidden layer and Sigmoid for the output layer.

## Results:
### --> Demonstrated the implementation of a simple ADALINE model as a baseline.
### --> Enhanced predictive capabilities with a multilayer neural network.
### --> This project provides a foundational understanding of neural network principles and their application in health-related predictions.
